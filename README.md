# Hey Sainty 🚀  

Hey there! This is **Hey Sainty**, my personal website where I share everything about me, my journey in tech, my projects, skills, achievements, and even some blogs. It's a mix of a portfolio and a blog, so if you're into tech, coding, or just curious about my experiences, you might find something interesting here!  

## Why I Built This?  
Originally, I started this as a simple portfolio project (because that's how most devs start, right?). But over time, I wanted it to be more than just a portfolio—I wanted a place to connect with the tech community, share my experiences, and create something useful. So yeah, this is me trying to build something bigger than just a static portfolio.  

## Features  
- **Portfolio Section**: Shows my skills, projects, education, and experience timeline.  
- **Blog Section**: I write about tech, my journey, tutorials, guides, and more.  
- **User Accounts**: You can sign up via email (OTP verification) or Google OAuth. Once logged in, you can comment on blogs.  
- **Admin Panel**: Only I can access this (no public admin accounts) because admins can add, delete, or edit content on the website.  
- **Secure Media Storage**: Blog images, profile pictures, and other media are stored securely in AWS S3.  

## Tech Stack  
This project is built using:  
- **Next.js** (for the frontend & backend)  
- **MongoDB (Atlas)** (for database)  
- **Tailwind CSS** (for styling)  
- **AWS S3** (for media storage)  
- **Vercel** (for deployment)  
- **Nodemailer** (for OTP emails)  
- **Google Analytics, Ahrefs, GSC** (for tracking & SEO)  

## Deployment & Performance  
The site is deployed on **Vercel** and uses **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** to keep things fast and SEO-friendly.  

## What's Next?  
Right now, users can only comment on blogs, but I have more features planned—maybe reactions on blogs, user profiles, and some cool personalization options. Stay tuned!
