            Hello, I'm Priyanshu Chaurasiya, originally from Azamgarh, Uttar
            Pradesh, India. I spent my formative years at KVN Public School in
            Varanasi. While I was an average student, my curiosity and passion
            for design started to blossom. After completing high school in 2018
            and intermediate studies in 2020, I decided to take a gap year
            before embarking on my journey in the world of technology.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p style={{ fontSize: "2vh" }}>
            Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science from Babu
            Banarasi Das Institute of Technology and Management in Lucknow.
            Despite my initial academic standing, I discovered a keen interest
            in designing, particularly in planning layouts and creating diverse
            and engaging structures. Although not adept at drawing or sketching,
            the conceptualization of visually appealing designs has always been
            a source of joy for me.

            Educational Journey
          </h2>

          <p style={{ fontSize: "2vh" }}>
            After a productive gap year, I enrolled in the field of Computer
            Science in pursuit of my passion for technology. As a student in the
            second year, I found a new passion for building an online presence,
            especially during the challenging days of lockdown. This led me to
            venture into blogging, hoping to establish a digital footprint.

            Passion for Development
          </h2>

          <p style={{ fontSize: "2vh" }}>
            My journey into the realms of web development and design began with
            a blend of interests â€“ a love for crafting online presence, a
            fascination with layouts, and my chosen field of study in B.Tech
            CSE. Over time, I delved into mastering tools like Canva and Figma,
            honing my skills in graphic design and layout creation.
            Simultaneously, I embarked on the path of web development,
            continuously learning and practicing the art.
